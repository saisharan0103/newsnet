You are an expert AI software architect, engineer, and project manager.Your job is to break down and plan the complete end-to-end development of the following MVP, in PHASES and TASKS, with clear priorities and time estimates.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:A decentralized news platform MVP for a hackathon.Core features:

Story Submission System (users submit local news)

Community Blockchain Voting (on story quality)

AI Content Moderation (auto screen inappropriate stories)

Token Rewards (contributors earn tokens per story vote)

Simple Frontend (clean UI for reading/interacting)

TECH STACK:

Frontend: React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Web3.js or Ethers.js

Backend: Node.js/Express, MongoDB, OpenAI API

Blockchain: Ethereum Sepolia or Polygon Mumbai, Solidity, Hardhat

AI: OpenAI API, sentiment analysis

SMART CONTRACTS:

NewsDAO.sol: story submission, voting, token distribution, basic governance

NewsToken.sol: ERC20 token, rewards, voting power



INSTRUCTIONS:

Create a detailed, PHASED plan:

List each phase (e.g. Smart Contract Dev, Backend, Frontend, Integration, Testing)

For each phase, break down TASKS in order

Assign ESTIMATED TIME (hours) for each task

Specify dependencies — what needs to be done first

Suggest the best approach for each part (what to code, how to structure, tools/libraries to use)

Highlight CRITICAL PATH tasks — what CANNOT slip

List possible pitfalls + mitigation

Output as a clear, step-by-step execution plan (markdown bullets or table)

NO FLUFF. I want execution details, not just general advice. Make sure this plan is specific to THIS MVP, tech stack.
