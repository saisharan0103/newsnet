Below is a suggested phased plan for building the decentralized news platform MVP. Time estimates assume a small team (1–2 engineers and 1 part-time PM).

---

## Phase 1 – Smart Contract Development
| Task | Est. Hours | Dependencies | Critical? | Notes / Approach |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **1.1 Define tokenomics** (reward amounts, voting weight) | 4h | none | ✔️ | Decide how votes translate to tokens. Clarify governance rules. |
| **1.2 Design NewsToken.sol (ERC20)** | 6h | 1.1 | ✔️ | Use OpenZeppelin ERC20 template. Add basic `mint` function for rewards. |
| **1.3 Implement NewsDAO.sol** (submission, voting, distribution) | 12h | 1.1 | ✔️ | Include mapping of story IDs to submission data, voting mechanism, interface with NewsToken. Use Hardhat. |
| **1.4 Unit tests for smart contracts** | 12h | 1.2, 1.3 | ✔️ | Hardhat tests with Mocha/Chai. Cover edge cases (double vote, invalid story, etc.). |
| **1.5 Deploy to Sepolia or Mumbai testnet** | 4h | 1.4 | ✔️ | Use Hardhat deploy scripts. |
| **1.6 Setup contract verification & docs** | 4h | 1.5 | | Etherscan/Polygonscan verification, short README for addresses. |

*Total Phase 1: ~42h*

## Phase 2 – Backend API & Database
| Task | Est. Hours | Dependencies | Critical? | Notes / Approach |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **2.1 Project scaffolding** (Node.js + Express) | 2h | none | ✔️ | Create repo structure, set up environment files. |
| **2.2 MongoDB schema design** | 4h | 2.1 | ✔️ | Collections for Users, Stories, Votes, Moderation logs. |
| **2.3 REST API endpoints** (`POST /story`, `GET /stories`, `POST /vote`, etc.) | 10h | 2.2 | ✔️ | Each endpoint interacts with smart contracts via Web3/Ethers. |
| **2.4 OpenAI API integration** (content moderation, sentiment analysis) | 6h | 2.2 | ✔️ | Auto-screen new stories before storing/submitting on-chain. |
| **2.5 JWT-based auth** (basic user auth, optional for hackathon) | 6h | 2.3 | | Use `express-jwt` / `passport-jwt`. For hackathon, a simple login or wallet-based. |
| **2.6 Unit tests for API** | 8h | 2.3-2.5 | | Mocha/Chai or Jest. Cover moderation / database logic. |

*Total Phase 2: ~36h*

## Phase 3 – Frontend Development
| Task | Est. Hours | Dependencies | Critical? | Notes / Approach |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **3.1 Set up Next.js project with Tailwind CSS** | 4h | none | ✔️ | Configure project; create base layout. |
| **3.2 Story submission form** | 6h | 2.x backend endpoints | ✔️ | Integrate with API, show pending moderation status. |
| **3.3 Story listing and details page** | 6h | 2.x | ✔️ | Fetch from backend; display vote counts, content. |
| **3.4 Voting interaction via Web3/Ethers.js** | 8h | 1.5, 3.3 | ✔️ | Connect wallet; call contract vote functions. |
| **3.5 Token balance display / rewards** | 4h | 3.4 | | Show user token balance via contract calls. |
| **3.6 Basic navigation & user flow** | 4h | 3.1-3.5 | | Smooth transitions; responsive design. |
| **3.7 Frontend unit/integration tests** (Jest/React Testing Library) | 6h | 3.2-3.6 | | Test forms, contract interactions, etc. |

*Total Phase 3: ~38h*

---

## Phase 4 – Integration & End-to-End Testing
| Task | Est. Hours | Dependencies | Critical? | Notes / Approach |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **4.1 Connect frontend to backend & blockchain** | 8h | Phases 1–3 | ✔️ | Ensure environment variables and contract addresses match. |
| **4.2 End-to-end happy-path tests** | 6h | 4.1 | ✔️ | Use Cypress or Playwright for user flows: submit → vote → receive tokens. |
| **4.3 Performance & security review** | 4h | 4.1 | | Check for basic injection vulnerabilities, rate limits. |
| **4.4 Fix integration bugs / iterate** | 10h | 4.2-4.3 | ✔️ | Buffer for unforeseen issues. |

*Total Phase 4: ~28h*

---

## Phase 5 – Deployment & Documentation
| Task | Est. Hours | Dependencies | Critical? | Notes / Approach |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **5.1 Deploy backend to cloud** (Heroku, Vercel, or similar) | 4h | 2.x completed | ✔️ | Provide environment variables for DB, API keys, contract addresses. |
| **5.2 Deploy frontend** (Vercel or Netlify) | 2h | 3.x completed | ✔️ | Configure environment for backend URL & network. |
| **5.3 Publish smart contracts** (addresses, ABIs) | 2h | 1.5 | ✔️ | Add to docs & environment configs. |
| **5.4 Create README & setup docs** | 4h | 5.1-5.3 | | Include how to run, how to contribute. |
| **5.5 Post-hackathon next steps** (optional features, backlog) | 2h | 5.4 | | Outline improvements. |

*Total Phase 5: ~14h*

---

## Critical Path Summary
1. **Smart contract design & deployment** – ensures tokens and voting exist.
2. **Backend API** – must be ready so frontend can interact.
3. **Frontend Web3 integration** – critical for voting & rewards.
4. **End-to-end integration** – user flows must be functional before launch.

Delays in any of these tasks will jeopardize the hackathon deliverable.

## Potential Pitfalls & Mitigation
- **Smart contract bugs** → Write thorough unit tests; use OpenZeppelin libraries to avoid re-implementing standard logic.
- **Slow AI moderation** → Cache OpenAI results or implement short circuiting for trusted users.
- **Web3 wallet connection issues** → Test with MetaMask early; handle network mismatches gracefully.
- **Tokenomics imbalance** → Keep rewards modest at first; allow parameters to be tweaked via DAO or config.
- **Team coordination** → Use clear Git branching, commit guidelines, and daily check-ins.

### Overall Estimated Effort
Total hours across all phases ≈ **158h** (approx. 4 full-time weeks for a small team). Adjust based on available resources and hackathon timeline. This plan emphasizes high-priority tasks for a functioning MVP while leaving room for improvements.
